This course will cover mostly the coding which will be done on google colab and will cover:

### Goal: 
- Understand the life cycle of a machine learning project: typical steps involved and tools that can be used in each step.
- Using machine learning algorithms to solve practical problems using libraries like scikit-learn and tensorflow.
- Fine tuning the algorithms through regularization, feature selection, and better models.    
- Develop an understanding of evaluation of machine learning algorithms and decide the next steps based on the analysis.
